# Simple Weather App

## Description

This is a basic weather application that i made for me to learn fetching data through and API. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a simple format. This app is not intended to be a full-featured weather application, but rather a starting point for understanding API interactions.

## Features

* Fetches current weather data from OpenWeatherMap.
* Displays basic weather information, including:
    * Temperature
    * Description
* Simple user interface.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* OpenWeatherMap API

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    \* `git clone <repository_url>`
2.  **Obtain an OpenWeatherMap API key:**
    \* Visit [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/) and create a free account.
    \* Follow the instructions to obtain your API key.
3.  **Add your API key:**
    \* You will need to add your API key to your JavaScript file.
    \* **Important:** For a more robust application, you should handle your API key securely (e.g., using environment variables in a backend environment).
4.  **Open the HTML file:**
    \* Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1.  Enter a city name in the search bar.
2.  Click the "Search" button.
3.  The app will display the current weather information for the specified city.

## Learning Points

* Making API requests using `fetch`.
* Handling API responses and parsing JSON data.
* Updating the DOM with data from an API.
* Basic HTML and CSS for structuring and styling a webpage.

## Disclaimer

* This is a simple learning project and may not include error handling or advanced features.
* I made a lot of blunder for this so please bear with me.
## Future Improvements

* Add error handling for invalid city names or API errors.
* Display more weather information (e.g., humidity, wind speed).
* Improve the user interface with more styling.
* Implement location services to automatically detect the user's location.
* Consider using a backend server to handle the API request and protect the API key.
